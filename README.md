# Embedded-Solr-Cloud
How to embed Apache Solr Cloud in your unit tests. 
Looking at the solr code base, i noticed they have tests for solr cloud cluster, so i thought of writing some tests using their classes.

# To run tests
mvn clean compile test

# What has been demonstrated here ?

1. creation of solr cloud cluster using 1 node and 1 zookeeper instance
2. how to create a collection along with its configs
3. connecting to this solr cloud using solr cloud client i.e. using zookeeper url


# Notes:
1. Embedded Solr Cloud is not the same as Embedded Solr Server.
2. The tests create 2 directories 'SOLR_HOME' and 'ZK_DIR'. The test might fail if they exist, so simply delete them and tests will pass.
